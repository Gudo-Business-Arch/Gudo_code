--What we did today--
Finally got thing working (somewhat) as a browser extension
determined image weight stuff is probably out of scope. It might be needed if we scale up if google doesn't work out.
--What is the plan for next week--
do planning again.
look into using google search api to pull up images.
figure out why extension isn't polling microphone.
fix the first word not doing anything.
--impediments--
(Same as yesterday)
Charles does a poor job of explaining things, and minimal programming knowledge is getting in the way, but is half decent at fixing some bugs. George pretty much had the basis down pretty good, but additions have been lacking, due to our combined lack of programming knowledge.
